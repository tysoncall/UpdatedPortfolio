​
      <p>I am Tyson and am excited to tell you a little bit about myself. I am 25 years old and was born in Colorado but jumped around growing up quite a bit.</p>
​
      <p>Currently, I am in the sales industry but as you can tell from this portfolio I am transitioning into a software development career path. </p>
​
      <p>In my free time I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend Savannah and son Gideon. A few of my passions include sports, astronomy, animals and video games. I am determined to be successful for not only myself, but more importantly for my family!</p>
